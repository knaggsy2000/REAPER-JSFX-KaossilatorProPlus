# REAPER-JSFX-KaossilatorProPlus

## DanMNTFKKP (MIDI Note Translator For KORG Kaossilator Pro+)
An REAPER (https://www.reaper.fm/) JSFX (https://www.reaper.fm/sdk/js/js.php) plugin which translates MIDI notes/pitch/aftertouch into MIDI CC commands that the KORG Kaossilator Pro+ (http://www.korg.com/uk/products/dj/kaossilator_pro_plus/) understands allowing the use of standard MIDI notes to control the KP+.


### Usage
Just drop the plugin onto an track, set the receiving MIDI channel, set the sending MIDI channel, and setup the audio inputs (for monitoring/recording).  Now just send MIDI notes on that track just like you do with any other synth and enjoy.
You can set an fixed Y-axis in the plugin or modulate it using the channel aftertouch/pressure CC.  Don't forget to set the note range on your KP+ to FULL and the key scale to OFF.
